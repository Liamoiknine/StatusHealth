Incidental ingestion of contaminated well water or produce in areas where DNOC was heavily used could occur, but such scenarios are expected to be very localized. DNOC can also form salts (sodium or ammonium DNOC) which are water-soluble, potentially leaching into groundwater; this was a concern in past contamination events.

DNOC has been associated with fatalities; it can cause hyperthermia (dangerously high body temperature) and metabolic acidosis.
