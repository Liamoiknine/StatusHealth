      "header": "Overview and Common Uses",
      "content": "This category covers synthetic compounds used in personal care, cleaning, fragrance, plastic packaging and home furnishings. Many of these chemicals serve as plasticizers, solvents, fixatives, surfactants or preservatives in consumer goods and are documented in biomonitoring and toxicology literature for their widespread application in household-product systems.",

      "content": "Routine human exposure happens through contact with consumer goods containing these substances—via skin contact, inhalation of volatile components, ingestion of residues from packaging or dust, and leaching from treated materials into food or indoor air.",

      "header": "Health and Toxicological Information",
      "content": "Toxicology and biomonitoring studies report that certain compounds in this category may interact with hormonal, reproductive or metabolic pathways at elevated exposure levels. While levels measured in the general population are typically low, research continues into cumulative exposures and low-dose effects from long-term contact with consumer goods.",

      "header": "Regulatory and Monitoring Context",
      "content": "In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates ingredients in cosmetics and personal care items, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains biomonitoring programs to track chemical presence in human tissues. National surveys show that exposures to many household-product chemicals are measurable and evolving, and regulatory frameworks are adapting to reflect emerging exposure science.",
